This folder is meant for testing a demo with the Rickshaw library.  It's an open source charting library developed by Shutterstock.

Currently no demo is implemented since Rickshaw relies upon d3, hence uses SVG rather than canvas. We are prioritizing 
libraries that use canvas because of their better performance.
